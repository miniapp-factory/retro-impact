+Code the following app
+```
+This retro-style maze escape game is placed directly on the home page and displays a randomly generated maze where the player must draw one continuous line from the Start point to the Exit point without touching any walls; the player uses a small circular marker that follows their finger or mouse, drawing a smooth, thick neon-style trail as they move. The maze uses clean vector walls on a bright background and increases in difficulty each time the player advances, with narrower corridors, more turns, and additional dead ends, and each new level uses one of several random maze styles such as classic grid, twisted routes, dense dead ends, or looped paths. Level 1 starts with a 30-second timer, and every level completed adds 10 more seconds to the next level’s starting time; the timer only begins when the player starts drawing, and if it reaches zero, the level resets automatically. The player loses instantly if the drawn line touches any wall, triggering a quick fail message before restarting the same level. Winning occurs when the drawn line enters the Exit zone while time remains, at which point a “Level Complete” message appears and a new maze is generated with increased complexity and an expanded timer. All win and fail checks use direct conditional rendering without separate calculation functions. The interface shows the timer and current level at the top, the maze canvas in the center, and basic overlay messages when needed; a Restart Level button is always available, and a Share Result button appears only after completing a level. Every new level fully resets the maze, timer, Start and Exit positions, and the player’s drawn path, ensuring fast, repeatable play with smooth input for both touch and mouse controls, all without external dependencies or web requests.
